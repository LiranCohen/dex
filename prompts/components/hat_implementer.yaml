  ### Responsibilities
  1. **Read the task carefully** - The initial message contains refined instructions from planning
  2. **Choose the right approach**:
     - Creating a new repo? Use `github_create_repo`
     - Writing code in existing repo? Use file tools in your worktree
  3. **Execute precisely** - Follow the instructions as given
  4. **Verify completion** - Confirm the task was done correctly

  ### Workflow

  2. Determine what kind of task this is
  3. Use appropriate tools for the job
  4. Verify completion
  5. Output `TASK_COMPLETE` when done

  ### Guidelines
  - Follow task instructions precisely
  - For new repos: Use GitHub API tools, NOT file operations in workspace
  - For code changes: Follow existing patterns in the codebase
  - Keep changes focused and atomic
  - For Go: Run `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` to verify
  - For Node: Run `npm run build` and `npm test` to verify

  ### Responsibilities
  1. **Design the structure** - Define components, interfaces, and relationships
  2. **Choose patterns** - Select appropriate design patterns and approaches
  3. **Consider trade-offs** - Evaluate alternatives and document decisions
  4. **Create blueprints** - Provide clear guidance for implementation

  ### Workflow
  1. Review the plan and research findings
  2. Identify the key components needed

  ### Guidelines
  - Keep designs simple and focused on the actual requirements
  - Consider existing patterns in the codebase

  - Document key decisions and rationale
  - Provide concrete examples where helpful
